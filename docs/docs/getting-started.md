# Getting Started

Welcome to Abyss! This guide will help you get up and running with your AI launchpad in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [ ] A compatible operating system (Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, or Linux)
- [ ] Python 3.8 or higher
- [ ] An internet connection for AI model downloads
- [ ] At least 4GB of available storage space

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

First, install Abyss using pip:

```bash
pip install abyss-ai
```

Or if you prefer using conda:

```bash
conda install -c abyss abyss-ai
```

### 2. Initial Setup

After installation, initialize your Abyss workspace:

```bash
abyss init
```

This will create a new configuration file and download the necessary AI models.

### 3. Your First AI Session

Start an interactive Abyss session:

```bash
abyss chat
```

Try asking your first question:

```
You: Hello Abyss, can you help me write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers?
```

Abyss will generate a complete, optimized solution with explanations!

## Core Concepts

### Workspaces

Abyss organizes your work into **workspaces**. Each workspace can have its own:

- Configuration settings
- Custom models and plugins  
- Project-specific context
- Conversation history

### AI Models

Abyss supports multiple AI models:

- **GPT-4**: Best for complex reasoning and code generation
- **Claude**: Excellent for analysis and writing
- **Local Models**: Privacy-focused options that run entirely on your machine

### Plugins

Extend Abyss with plugins for:

- **Development**: Code completion, testing, documentation
- **Content**: Writing assistance, SEO optimization  
- **Productivity**: Task management, calendar integration
- **Custom**: Build your own plugins with the Abyss SDK

## Basic Usage Examples

### Code Generation

```bash
abyss generate --type function --lang python --description "Sort a list using quicksort algorithm"
```

### Content Creation

```bash
abyss write --type blog-post --topic "Machine Learning Trends 2024" --length 1000
```

### Data Analysis

```bash
abyss analyze --file data.csv --question "What are the top 3 trends in this dataset?"
```

## Configuration

Customize Abyss by editing your config file:

```yaml
# ~/.abyss/config.yml
default_model: "gpt-4"
temperature: 0.7
max_tokens: 2048
plugins:
  - code-completion
  - writing-assistant
  - data-analyzer
```
